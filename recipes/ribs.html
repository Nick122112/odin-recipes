    <p>
      These are the best ribs! Baking low and slow is our secret to fall of the
      bone oven-baked ribs. Some people think that ribs should be left to the
      “pit masters” — it’s just not true. Baking ribs in the oven is seriously
      easy. All you need is time — 95% of the recipe time is sitting back and
      relaxing while the ribs bake. Let’s do this!
      <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>2 to 2 1/2 pounds baby back pork ribs</li>
          <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
          <li>Your favorite barbecue sauce</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Remove the membrane (this ensures fall off the bone ribs)</li>
          <li>Generously season both sides with salt and pepper. This is also a great opportunity for adding more flavor with your favorite spice rub.</li>
          <li>Cover the ribs with aluminum foil.</li>
          <li>Bake the ribs at a low temperature (275°F) for 2 ½ to 4 hours or until they are tender.</li>
          <li>Slather the baked ribs with barbecue sauce, and then broil (or grill) the ribs for a few minutes until the sauce is caramelized.</li>
      </ol>
